  Hi, I'm **Avior Peretz**, a Software Engineer based in Rishon LeTsiyon, Israel. For over 7 years, I've been immersed in the world of software development, focusing on building robust, scalable applications and systems that drive business value and innovation.

  My journey started with fullstack development training at **John Bryce** in Jerusalem, where I discovered my passion for both frontend and backend technologies. I also served as a **Sigint Operator & Commander** in the 8200 Intelligence Corps, which taught me discipline, attention to detail, and the importance of reliable systems.

  ### My Technical Philosophy

  My development philosophy is centered on **scalability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**. I believe great software starts with understanding the business requirements and architecting solutions that can grow with the organization. I leverage modern technologies like Vue.js, React, Node.js, and Go to build systems that are both efficient and future-proof.

  I strive to create applications that perform seamlessly under load, with clean architectures and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines. Whether I'm implementing microfrontend architectures or optimizing backend services, my focus is always on delivering value through robust, well-tested code.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the constant evolution of technology and the challenge of solving complex problems at scale. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a system handle thousands of users efficiently or mentoring a junior developer to grow their skills.

  ### Beyond the Code

  When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or staying up-to-date with the latest developments in cloud architecture and software engineering practices.

  Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to browse my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/#contact) if you'd like to collaborate!
